Fastfude is a website created back in late 1997 to serve as a social network (though the term didn't back exist then) for the musicians and music fans of [Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_ireland). 

The basic goal of the site is to act as a hub for people interested in music from in-and-around the region to interact, collaborate and trade, spawning new relationships and projects that feed back into the music scene.

This github project hosts the source code for the website. Anyone is welcome to [contribute code](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), request [enhancements](https://github.com/junap/Fastfude/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open) or report [bugs](https://github.com/junap/Fastfude/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open).

The site is built using the [Codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) framework on a standard [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) stack.

To get started:

- set up a local LAMP development environment
