Fastfude is a website created back in late 1997 to serve as a social network (though the term didn't exist back then) for the musicians and music fans of [Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_ireland). 

The basic goal of the site is to act as a hub for people interested in music from in-and-around the region to interact, collaborate and trade, spawning new relationships and projects that feed back into the music scene.

The (old) site is currently hosted at http://fastfude.org/

A live copy of the beta is at http://beta.fastfude.org/ (Password protected to keep Google out! u: scenewreckers, p: hardmen)

This github project hosts the source code for the website. Anyone is welcome to [contribute code](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), request [enhancements](https://github.com/junap/Fastfude/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open) or report [bugs](https://github.com/junap/Fastfude/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open).

The site is built using the [Codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) framework on a standard [LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) stack.
